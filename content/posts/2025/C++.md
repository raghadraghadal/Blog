# 🗡️ C++ – Batman (Bruce Wayne)
“Dark, complex, and gets the job done… if you know how to use it.”

C++ is the Batman of programming languages. It’s not the easiest to learn, but in the right hands, it’s an unstoppable force. Need raw power? Low-level access? High performance? C++ delivers, just like Batman with his gadgets. However, one wrong move (like a memory leak), and things crash hard.

🦇 Superpowers: Extreme performance, control over hardware, used in game engines and high-performance apps.
💣 Weakness: Difficult to master, memory management nightmares.
