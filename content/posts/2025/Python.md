# Python – Iron Man (Tony Stark)
“Smart, versatile, and does all the heavy lifting.”

Python is the Tony Stark of programming languages. It’s rich, powerful, and everyone wants to work with it. Need AI? Data Science? Web Dev? Python’s got a tool (or library) for everything. Like Iron Man’s suit upgrades, Python keeps evolving, making things easier and flashier.

🚀 Superpowers: Machine learning, automation, web development, and making beginners feel like geniuses.
💀 Weakness: Slower than lower-level languages. Needs powerful hardware (just like Tony’s suit).
