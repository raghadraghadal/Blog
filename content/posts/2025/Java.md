# 🦸‍♂️ Java – Superman (Clark Kent)
“Old-school, reliable, and runs EVERYWHERE.”

Java is Superman: it’s been around forever, it’s crazy powerful, and it’s everywhere—from web apps to Android devices. It might not be the flashiest, but you know it’s dependable. When things break, Java is there, catching falling applications like Superman catches buildings.

💪 Superpowers: Cross-platform compatibility, OOP mastery, and enterprise-level strength.
🦸 Weakness: Verbose syntax—Java developers spend half their time just typing.
